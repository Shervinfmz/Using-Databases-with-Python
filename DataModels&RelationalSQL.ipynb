    "## Step 1: Visualize the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in building a data model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drawing a **picture** of the data objects used in the application\n",
    "- Identifying what real-world objects the application needs to store\n",
    "- Understanding how these objects are related to each other\n",

    "This visual representation helps clarify the structure before writing any SQL.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Representing Objects and Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying the data objects, we determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How each object should be represented as a **table**\n",
    "- What attributes (columns) each object needs\n",
    "- How tables are connected using **relationships**\n",

    "## Basic Rule of Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Do not store the same string data more than once.  \n",
    "> Use relationships instead.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Avoid duplicating the same information in multiple tables\n",
    "- Store the data once and reference it using keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Store a user’s name once in a `Users` table\n",
    "- Reference that user in other tables using a user ID\n",

    "## One Real-World Thing = One Database Record\n",

    "## Designing a Relational Data Model (Objects, Attributes, and Relationships)\n",
    "\n",
    "Good database design starts by carefully examining **each piece of information**\n",
    "and deciding how it should be stored. The goal is to create a clean, normalized,\n",
    "and easy-to-maintain relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object or Attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "For every piece of data (column), we must ask a key question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Is this an object on its own, or just an attribute of another object?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Music Application Example\n",
    "\n",
    "From a music dataset, we can identify the following **objects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artist**\n",
    "- **Album**\n",
    "- **Track**\n",
    "- **Genre**\n",
    "\n",
    "These represent real-world entities and therefore should become **tables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, some values are **attributes**, not standalone objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Len (length)** → attribute of a Track  \n",
    "- **Rating** → attribute of a Track (or possibly a User–Track relationship)  \n",
    "- **Count** → attribute (e.g., play count)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects → Tables  \n",
    "- Attributes → Columns  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying Objects First\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any SQL, we should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify real-world objects\n",
    "2. Decide which objects deserve their own tables\n",
    "3. Avoid mixing multiple concepts into a single table\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the database schema easier to understand, extend, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Relationships Between Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the objects are clear, the next step is defining how they relate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Track belongs to an Album**\n",
    "- An **Album belongs to an Artist**\n",
    "- A **Track belongs to a Genre**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are **belongs-to relationships** and are implemented using **foreign keys**,\n",
    "not repeated text values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why We Avoid Repeated Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing text like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"AC/DC\"`\n",
    "- `\"Who Made Who\"`\n",
    "- `\"Rock\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "in every row, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store each Artist once\n",
    "- Store each Album once\n",
    "- Store each Genre once\n",
    "- Reference them using IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows a fundamental database design rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **When there is one thing in the real world,\n",
    "> there should be one copy of that thing in the database.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Track Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Track** has descriptive attributes that belong directly to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Len** → track duration  \n",
    "- **Rating** → user rating  \n",
    "- **Count** → number of plays  \n",
    "\n",
    "These values should be stored as columns in the `Track` table,\n",
    "not as separate tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Relational Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified relational design might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artist(id, name)**\n",
    "- **Album(id, title, artist_id)**\n",
    "- **Genre(id, name)**\n",
    "- **Track(id, title, len, rating, count, album_id, genre_id)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table has a clear responsibility and no duplicated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of This Design\n",
    "\n",
    "- No duplicated text data\n",
    "- Easier updates (change once, reflected everywhere)\n",
    "- Smaller database size\n",
    "- Faster queries\n",
    "- Clear and understandable schema\n",
    "- Follows normalization principles\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is treated as a simple column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data duplication increases\n",
    "- Updates become error-prone\n",
    "- The database becomes hard to scale\n",
    "\n",
    "If objects and attributes are modeled correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data is stored once\n",
    "- Relationships are explicit\n",
    "- Queries are more powerful and flexible\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "> Good database design comes from asking the right questions about\n",
    "> each piece of information before storing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think first.  \n",
    "Design second.  \n",
    "Write SQL last.  \n",
