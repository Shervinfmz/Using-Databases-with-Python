    "## Many-to-Many Relationships in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, many-to-many relationships occur when multiple rows in one table are associated with multiple rows in another table. This relationship is represented using a third table that holds the foreign keys from both tables, creating a link between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a **Track** table and a **Genre** table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Genre** has a one-to-many relationship with **Track** (one genre can be associated with multiple tracks).\n",
    "- A single **Track** can belong to many genres, and a **Genre** can have many **Tracks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tables involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Genre** table: Stores the genre information.\n",
    "2. **Track** table: Stores track information, including a foreign key pointing to the **Genre** table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Query for Many-to-Many Relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve tracks and their genres, we join the **Track** table with the **Genre** table on the `genre_id` column:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Track.title, Genre.name\n",
    "FROM Track\n",
    "JOIN Genre ON Track.genre_id = Genre.id;\n",

    "- **Authors** can write many **Books**.\n",

    "1. `book_id` referencing the **Books** table.\n",
    "2. `author_id` referencing the **Authors** table.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no separate primary key in the junction table since the combination of both foreign keys serves as a unique identifier for each relationship.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Author-Book Junction Table**  \n",
    "    - `book_id` (Foreign Key referencing **Books**)\n",
