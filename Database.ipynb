    "## Database Basics: Key Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into using databases with Python, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts from relational database theory. This section introduces the core terminology to help you think like a database professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Overview of Relational Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "A **relation** is defined as a set of **tuples** that share the same **attributes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **tuple** (row) usually represents an object (e.g., a person, track, or concept) and contains information about that object.\n",
    "- Objects are typically physical things or abstract concepts.\n",
    "- A relation is usually described as a **table**, organized into rows and columns.\n",
    "- All data in a single attribute (column) belong to the same **domain** and follow the same constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Relational model diagram showing Relation (table), Tuples (rows), and Attribute (column)](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/understanding_relational_dbs/tuples_chart_final.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Real-World Analogy: Spreadsheet as a Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a spreadsheet (like in Excel) as a simple example of a relational table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Columns** = Attributes (e.g., TITLE, RATING, LEN)\n",
    "- **Rows** = Tuples (each row represents one music track)\n",
    "- The entire sheet/tab = Relation/Table\n",

    "![Spreadsheet example labeled with Columns/Attributes, Rows/Tuples, and Tables/Relations](https://nishantmunjal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database**  \n",
    "  A collection of organized data, typically containing many tables that store related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relation (or Table)**  \n",
    "  A structured collection of data organized into rows and columns. It contains tuples (rows) and attributes (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuple (or Row/Record)**  \n",
    "  A single entry in a table — a set of related values that represent one \"object\" or entity, such as a person, a student, or a music track.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attribute (or Column/Field)**  \n",
    "  A specific piece of data in a tuple — one property of the entity, such as name, age, or grade. Each column has a name and a data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Example Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple representation of a `students` table (like the one we'll use in the Python examples):\n",
    "\n",
    "| id (Primary Key) | name     | age | grade |\n",
    "|------------------|----------|-----|-------|\n",
    "| 1                | Alice    | 20  | 95.5  |\n",
    "| 2                | Bob      | 22  | 88.0  |\n",
    "| 3                | Charlie  | 21  | 92.3  |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes (columns)**: `id`, `name`, `age`, `grade`\n",
    "- **Tuples (rows)**: Each student's data row\n",
    "- **Relation**: The entire `students` table\n",
    "- **Database**: Could contain this table plus others (e.g., courses, enrollments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these terms will make working with SQL and Python's `sqlite3` much clearer — tables are relations, rows are tuples, and columns are attributes!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're ready to proceed to connecting and manipulating databases in Python. 🚀"

    "### Retrieving Records with SQL: SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve a group of records from a table.  \n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users;\n",

    "\n",
    "This statement retrieves all records from the users table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using WHERE with SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "The WHERE clause allows you to filter records based on specific criteria.\n",
    "For example, to retrieve the user with the email csev@umich.edu:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "SELECT * FROM users\n",
    "Retrieves all columns and all rows from the users table.\n",

    "### Sorting Data with SQL: ORDER BY\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add an `ORDER BY` clause to `SELECT` statements to sort the results in ascending or descending order.\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users\n",

    "```\n",
    "This will return all records sorted alphabetically by the email column in ascending order.\n",

    "### Example 2: Sorting by name\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users\n",
    "ORDER BY name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return all records sorted alphabetically by the name column.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sorting in Descending Order\n",
    "\n",
    "To sort in descending order, add the `DESC` keyword after the column name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users\n",
    "ORDER BY email DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement sorts the `users` table by `email` in descending order (Z to A).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also combine `ASC` and `DESC` to sort by multiple columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users\n",
    "ORDER BY name ASC, email DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will sort the `users` table first by `name` (ascending), and then by `email` (descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why ORDER BY Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting is helpful for organizing your data before presenting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to get the most relevant or ordered data for reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting makes data analysis easier when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "`ORDER BY` is used in **Read** operations (the **R** in CRUD):\n",

    "Seeing real data inside the table helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how SQL stores information\n",
    "- Verify that your table was created correctly\n",
    "- Prepare for reading and writing data using Python\n",
