    "## Database Basics: Key Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into using databases with Python, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts from relational database theory. This section introduces the core terminology to help you think like a database professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Overview of Relational Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "A **relation** is defined as a set of **tuples** that share the same **attributes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **tuple** (row) usually represents an object (e.g., a person, track, or concept) and contains information about that object.\n",
    "- Objects are typically physical things or abstract concepts.\n",
    "- A relation is usually described as a **table**, organized into rows and columns.\n",
    "- All data in a single attribute (column) belong to the same **domain** and follow the same constraints.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Real-World Analogy: Spreadsheet as a Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a spreadsheet (like in Excel) as a simple example of a relational table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Columns** = Attributes (e.g., TITLE, RATING, LEN)\n",
    "- **Rows** = Tuples (each row represents one music track)\n",
    "- The entire sheet/tab = Relation/Table\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spreadsheet example labeled with Columns/Attributes, Rows/Tuples, and Tables/Relations](https://nishantmunjal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database**  \n",
    "  A collection of organized data, typically containing many tables that store related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relation (or Table)**  \n",
    "  A structured collection of data organized into rows and columns. It contains tuples (rows) and attributes (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuple (or Row/Record)**  \n",
    "  A single entry in a table — a set of related values that represent one \"object\" or entity, such as a person, a student, or a music track.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attribute (or Column/Field)**  \n",
    "  A specific piece of data in a tuple — one property of the entity, such as name, age, or grade. Each column has a name and a data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Example Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple representation of a `students` table (like the one we'll use in the Python examples):\n",
    "\n",
    "| id (Primary Key) | name     | age | grade |\n",
    "|------------------|----------|-----|-------|\n",
    "| 1                | Alice    | 20  | 95.5  |\n",
    "| 2                | Bob      | 22  | 88.0  |\n",
    "| 3                | Charlie  | 21  | 92.3  |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes (columns)**: `id`, `name`, `age`, `grade`\n",
    "- **Tuples (rows)**: Each student's data row\n",
    "- **Relation**: The entire `students` table\n",
    "- **Database**: Could contain this table plus others (e.g., courses, enrollments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these terms will make working with SQL and Python's `sqlite3` much clearer — tables are relations, rows are tuples, and columns are attributes!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're ready to proceed to connecting and manipulating databases in Python. 🚀"
