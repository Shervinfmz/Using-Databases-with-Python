    "### Musical Track Database Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**:  \n",
    "Create a normalized SQLite database from an iTunes export file in CSV format. The structure of the database should include the following tables: **Artist**, **Genre**, **Album**, and **Track**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**:  \n",
    "You will write a program that processes the CSV file `tracks.csv` and stores the data in an SQLite3 database with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Artist (\n",
    "    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,\n",
    "    name    TEXT UNIQUE\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Genre (\n",
    "    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,\n",
    "    name    TEXT UNIQUE\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Album (\n",
    "    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,\n",
    "    artist_id  INTEGER,\n",
    "    title   TEXT UNIQUE\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Track (\n",
    "    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,\n",
    "    title TEXT UNIQUE,\n",
    "    album_id  INTEGER,\n",
    "    genre_id  INTEGER,\n",
    "    len INTEGER, rating INTEGER, count INTEGER\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Create the Database**:\n",
    "Create the above tables in your SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Process the CSV File**:\n",
    "The file `tracks.csv` contains the following columns (based on an example CSV file):\n",
    "- **Track name**\n",
    "- **Artist name**\n",
    "- **Album title**\n",
    "- **Genre**\n",
    "- **Track length**\n",
    "- **Track rating**\n",
    "- **Track play count**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Insert the Data into the Tables**:\n",
    "Insert the data into **Artist**, **Genre**, **Album**, and **Track** tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that **Artist** names are stored only once and referenced by **Album**.\n",
    "- **Genre** names should be stored only once and referenced by **Track**.\n",
    "- **Album** should reference **Artist** and **Track** should reference **Album** and **Genre**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Ensure Data Integrity**:\n",
    "- Use **foreign keys** to link **Album** and **Track** with **Artist** and **Genre**.\n",
    "- Use **INSERT OR IGNORE** to avoid duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Upload the Database**:\n",
    "After running the program and inserting data, upload the SQLite3 database (`.sqlite`) here.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "To grade the assignment, the following query will be used to verify your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name \n",
    "    FROM Track JOIN Genre JOIN Album JOIN Artist \n",
    "    ON Track.genre_id = Genre.ID and Track.album_id = Album.id \n",
    "        AND Album.artist_id = Artist.id\n",
    "    ORDER BY Artist.name LIMIT 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "To grade the assignment, the following query will be used to verify your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name \n",
    "    FROM Track JOIN Genre JOIN Album JOIN Artist \n",

    "        AND Album.artist_id = Artist.id\n",
    "    ORDER BY Artist.name LIMIT 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the Grading Query Should Return:\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the query should be similar to the following, and this is what you will use to verify that your data has been inserted correctly:\n",
    "\n",
