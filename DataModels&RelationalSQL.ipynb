    "\n",
    "Good database design starts by carefully examining **each piece of information**\n",

    "### Music Application Example\n",
    "\n",
    "From a music dataset, we can identify the following **objects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artist**\n",
    "- **Album**\n",
    "- **Track**\n",
    "- **Genre**\n",
    "\n",
    "These represent real-world entities and therefore should become **tables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, some values are **attributes**, not standalone objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Len (length)** → attribute of a Track  \n",

    "2. Decide which objects deserve their own tables\n",

    "## Track Attributes\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Len** → track duration  \n",
    "- **Rating** → user rating  \n",
    "- **Count** → number of plays  \n",

    "- **Genre(id, name)**\n",

    "- Data duplication increases\n",
    "- Updates become error-prone\n",
