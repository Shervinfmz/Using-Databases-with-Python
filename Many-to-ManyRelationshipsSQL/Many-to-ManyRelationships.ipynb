    "## Many-to-Many Relationships in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, many-to-many relationships occur when multiple rows in one table are associated with multiple rows in another table. This relationship is represented using a third table that holds the foreign keys from both tables, creating a link between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a **Track** table and a **Genre** table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Genre** has a one-to-many relationship with **Track** (one genre can be associated with multiple tracks).\n",
    "- A single **Track** can belong to many genres, and a **Genre** can have many **Tracks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tables involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Genre** table: Stores the genre information.\n",
    "2. **Track** table: Stores track information, including a foreign key pointing to the **Genre** table.\n",

    "### `user_id`\n",

    "- Relationships are enforced through **primary keys** and **foreign keys**\n",
    "- Invalid or duplicate relationships are prevented\n",

    "### Scalable Design\n",
    "- Additional attributes (such as `role`) can be added to the **Member** table\n",
